# D3 + React Workshop

Data visualization is not just a graph or a chart, but the experimentation of different media to curate and display a collection of data. D3 is a powerful and flexible tool that allows you to create complex and imaginative representations. React, on the other hand, is a JavaScript library that helps you build user interfaces. D3 combined with React opens a lot of possibilities when creating an interactive web application, however, these two technologies are not easily combined as they both handle the DOM.

This repository supports a free, online workshop hosted by [Imagine Dat](http://www.imagine-dat.com/) on August 22nd, 2020.
